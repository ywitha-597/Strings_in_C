    <h1>Real-World Applications of Strings in C</h1>

    <div class="application">
        <h2>Application 1: Text Processing</h2>
        <p>Strings in C are extensively used for text processing tasks such as parsing input, searching for keywords, and manipulating text data. Real-world examples include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Developing command-line utilities for text manipulation, such as search and replace tools.</li>
            <li>Implementing text editors and word processors that handle large text files efficiently.</li>
            <li>Building compilers and interpreters for programming languages where strings are essential for tokenizing source code.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="application">
        <h2>Application 2: Data Representation</h2>
        <p>Strings play a crucial role in representing and processing data in various formats. Real-world examples include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Storing and processing structured data in formats like JSON, XML, or CSV where strings are used to represent key-value pairs or data records.</li>
            <li>Implementing network protocols and data serialization formats where strings are used to encode and decode messages.</li>
            <li>Developing database management systems where strings are used to represent table names, column names, and query results.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="application">
        <h2>Application 3: File Handling</h2>
        <p>Strings are frequently used in file handling operations for reading from and writing to files. Real-world examples include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Processing log files generated by applications where strings are used to extract relevant information such as timestamps, error messages, and user actions.</li>
            <li>Implementing file compression and decompression utilities where strings are used to represent compressed data and metadata.</li>
            <li>Developing data migration and synchronization tools where strings are used to compare and merge data between different file versions or systems.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="application">
        <h2>Application 4: User Interfaces</h2>
        <p>Strings are integral to building user interfaces for various applications, including command-line interfaces (CLI) and graphical user interfaces (GUI). Real-world examples include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating CLI-based programs that interact with users through text-based menus, prompts, and dialogs.</li>
            <li>Developing GUI applications that display and manipulate text-based data such as documents, spreadsheets, and code editors.</li>
            <li>Building web applications where strings are used to represent HTML content, form data, and URLs.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
